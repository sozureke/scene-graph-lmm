Once you have the image, analyze it in detail and correctly and create a detailed JSON representation of its contents. We will be getting an image of the rooms from different angles, correctly analyze the provided photos and make sure you don't make any mistakes. Make sure the JSON includes a detailed list of all visible objects, their attributes and relationships between other objects, formatted as follows:

JSON should clearly identify each object using a unique integer identifier, list its attributes (colour, material, size, state) and describe its relationships to other objects using the assigned identifiers. Each object field must be correctly populated. Each object must have a correct relationship between another object. Include accurate and concise descriptions based on the visual information provided in the image.
