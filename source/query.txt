Analyze the image in detail and create a comprehensive JSON representation of its contents. The image will be of rooms from different angles. Ensure the analysis is accurate with no mistakes.

The JSON should include:
- A unique integer identifier for each object.
- Attributes of each object (colour, material, size, state).
- Relationships between objects using their identifiers.
- Accurate and concise descriptions based on the visual information.

Each object field must be correctly populated, and relationships between objects must be accurately described.
